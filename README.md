# Leap Year Check

Write a program that will take a year and check if it is a leap year. 


Leap Years occur when...

```plain
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    except every year that is evenly divisible by 400.
```

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is.
1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.
